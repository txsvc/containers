This image serves as the base image to build other images.

This base image also provides the default user (1001) you should use to run your
application. Your Dockerfile should include this instruction after you finish
installing software:

USER default

The default directory for installing your application sources is
'/opt/app-root/src' and the WORKDIR and HOME for the 'default' user is set
to this directory as well.
